mobile device such as a cellphone or tablet. The use case is any temporary engagement such as the 
cordination of wedding, funeral, graduation, christening etc. The idea is to cordinate the various
activies and persons involved in the organization and delivery of the event from the initial
announcement (e.g. of the birth) to the day of the scheduled event.
